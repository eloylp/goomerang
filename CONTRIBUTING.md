## Contributing to Goomerang

All contributions are welcome. Ideas, code, documentation, production experiences, bugfixes ... we only need to define some key
ideas in order to make this more efficient.

### Key ideas of this project

* Good documentation.
* The project strives for simplicity.
* The library itself represents a spirit of composition, we are enablers for the users, not drivers.
* Use testing strategies wisely. Take care of testing code equal or better than production one.

### I have an idea

Creating a new issue it's generally a good way to share your idea and get feedback. We do not have templates for issues. We consider
creating good issues and documentation part of the creative process, and we don't want to interfere on it. However, its encouraged to
provide as much context as possible. Feel free to talk about a specific use case, show the maintainers what we are trying to solve.

If the contribution it's a bugfix, a little feature or documentation improvement that could be implemented in, lets say, a couple of days at
maximum, one could go directly for a PR. It's fine.

### Pull requests

In general, contributions should be done by the typical fork workflow. In this workflow, developers fork this repository and then just
submit pull requests to this one.

### The Lab

Goomerang provides a laboratory for simulating a production environment. Check it [here](internal/lab/README.md).

### Git and releases

The project follows [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning, and we keep a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). To keep it simple, initially
this project will just use a master branch and feature branches.

### Conduct

the T.H.I.N.K test, by asking the following questions. Is it ...

T. Truthful?
H. Helpful?
I. Inspiring/Interesting?
