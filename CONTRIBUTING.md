## Contributing to Goomerang

All contributions are welcome. Ideas, code, documentation, production experiences, bugfixes ... we only need to define some key
ideas in order to make this more efficient.

### Key ideas

* Good documentation.
* The project strives for simplicity.
* The library itself represents a spirit of composition, it enables users, it doesn't try to drive them.
* Use testing strategies wisely. Take care of testing code equal or better than production one.

### Issues

Creating a new issue it's generally a good way to share your ideas and get feedback. We do not have templates for issues. We consider
creating good issues and documentation its part of the creative process, and we don't want to interfere on it. However, it's encouraged to
provide as much context as possible. Feel free to talk about a specific use case, show the maintainers what we are trying to solve.

Explore the available labels in order to proper categorize it and get the fastest feedback.

If the contribution it's a bugfix, a little feature or documentation improvement that could be implemented in, lets say, a couple of days at
maximum, one could go directly for a PR. It's fine.

### Pull requests

In general, contributions should be done by the typical fork workflow. In this workflow, developers fork this repository and then just
submit pull requests to this one.

### The Lab

Goomerang provides a laboratory for simulating a production environment. Check it [here](internal/lab/README.md).

### Git and releases

The project follows [semver](https://semver.org/) for versioning, and we keep a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). To keep it simple, initially
this project will just use a master branch and feature branches.

### Conduct

Whenever you are interacting, just ensure that your interaction (issue, comment, reply ...) passes
the T.H.I.N.K test, by asking the following questions. Is it ...

T. Truthful?
H. Helpful?
I. Inspiring/Interesting?
N. Necessary?
K. Kind?
